Ogre Butchers use shamanic rites that revolve around devouring parts of their victims, the items acting as fetishes that channel the raw power of the Great Maw. These Gut Magic spells explain why Ogre Butchers often appear to be walking larders, as to cast one of his shamanic spells the Butcher must physically eat anything from a nice healthy heart to a stinking pile of guts. In this act, he communes with the power of the Great Maw, taking some of it for himself and bestowing the rest upon his comrades that they might run roughshod over their enemies, or inflicting painful curses upon the heads of his foes.</p>\n<p>Gut Magic spells work in a slightly different manner to other spells, because instead of manipulating the winds of magic, the Butcher is calling upon the power of his God and channeling it through a focus - Gut Magic spells are more religious miracle than arcane science.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</p>\n<p><strong>Lore Effect:</strong> Before casting, you may spend multiple ingredients.

Travelling mercenaries beyond peer, they have spent decades accruing scars, tall tales, wealth, exotic wargear and skills before heading back to the Ogre Kingdoms.</p>\n<p>Maneaters have fought throughout the Old World and beyond and many races attempt to recruit such fighters into their armies, promising food, gold or whatever else the Ogres want in return for their services. It is the pay that matters, not the foe, although with some contracts Maneaters are awarded fallen enemies to eat, so in those cases the enemy may matter. Ogres will eat anything, but they have preferences.</p>\n<p>Maneaters inherit the cultures of the lands they visit rather than spread their own. These mercenaries learn the fighting skills and adopt the style of dress appropriate to the lands in which they fight. For example, a Maneater in the Empire might wear breeches and an ostentatious feather with a brace of huge pistols across his chest or a Maneater employed by Vampires may use fanged dentures to appear like their employers. A Maneater campaigning in the jungles of the Southlands might go into battle as the Savage Orcs do, that is, wearing an undersized loincloth, a gut-plate and nothing else but smeary warpaint, although more civilized folk might not want to visualize that. Maneaters tend to operate in small groups, some of which have fought together for years. Despite their outlandish appearance, these tight-knit bands excel at breaking heads.</p>\n<p>It's rare for any two Maneaters to fight or be equipped in exactly the same manner, and opponents find themselves fighting against a dizzying array of different weapons and combat techniques. The only real factors uniting the individualistic Maneaters are their monumentally inflated sense of self-worth and their capacity to smash aside lesser creatures without breaking a sweat. When they return to the Ogre Kingdoms, Maneaters take an opportunity to bore their tribemates with long fanciful war stories, some of which are even true. Although such tales are tiresome, an Ogre Tyrant is always happy if he can call on the services of one or two units of Maneaters to aid his tribe. They will be used to lead important attacks or hold a vital part of the battle line. Maneaters are famously stubborn opponents and usually prefer to fight to their last breath rather than flee. After all, they have learned the hard way that if they run off in the course of a battle, they won't get paid!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Ogre</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Ranger</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Maneater Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 640px;

It is this bold resilience that attracts Ogres to Mournfangs -- for it is hard not to respect an animal that will continue to bite and slash even when its brain has ceased to function. Ogres have tried to capture and break the beasts for mounts since they first encountered the Mournfang -- although for centuries every attempt ended in death or crippling injuries for the Ogres. Over the years it has become a sort of rite of Ogrehood, as young aspirants head up the mountains in their attempts to capture one of the savage beasts. Few survive the brutal encounter, for the Mournfang are strong enough to take down any Ogre Bull, but such are the rewards for claiming this mighty beast that many still continue this fatal tradition, even at the cost of many lives.</p>\n<p>There is a fortune to be made as a mercenary for a young Ogre with his own Mournfang, and every spring a few stout lads from the upper slopes will join together and sell their services as the heaviest shock cavalry in the known world. Powered by thick haunches of purest muscle, Mournfangs surge towards the foe at a speed faster than their muscle-bulked frames would suggest, not slowed in the least by the large Ogre or saddle atop its hairy back. Protected by thick skin and coarse shaggy hair, enemy arrows bounce off the oncoming beast or ping off the Ogre's armor as harmless as hailstones.</p>\n<p>Rhinox Cavalry are Ogres who ride the fearsome juggernauts known as Rhinoxen. Rhinox Cavalry are a rarer sight than Mournfang Cavalry. This is mostly due to the fact that Rhinoxen are large and ornery beasts and are thus quite difficult to tame. Even when broken to saddle, the extreme stubborness and poor eyesight of the Rhinox makes it hard to maneuver them on the battlefield with anything remotely resembling accuracy This means that only the toughest and most determined members of an Ogre tribe can do so.</p>\n<p>There is a rite of Ogrehood practiced in the Ogre tribes of the Mountains of Mourn. Aspiring Bulls will stalk and hunt an adolescent Rhinox while it performs its own violent rite of passage &ndash; a brutal contest of strength that involves high-speed collisions and a lot of blood. A protracted Rhinox leadership challenge will usually result in the death of the losing party, as even these badtempered hulks of muscle and matted hair can bleed to death. However, the Rhinox, as with all species native to the Mountains of Mourn, is extremely resilient. Even when its brain has ceased to function, it will continue to fight, slashing and biting in its death throes. It is at this point that the hunting Ogre will launch his ambush.</p>\n<p>For the successful aspirants, there follows a period in which the would-be Rhinox rider must remain in the saddle at all times and steer the beast with his club. With its walnut-sized brain addled by the repeated blows, the Rhinox slowly becomes accustomed to bearing a rider. Once a Rhinox has been broken in this manner, it is just about possible to domesticate it. Ogre Rhinox riders return to their tribe with their prize &ndash; but not for long. There is a fortune to be made as a mercenary for a young Ogre with his own Rhinox, and every spring, a few new Bulls from the upper slopes will join together and sell their services as the heaviest shock cavalry known to the Warhammer world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Ogre</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mournfang Cavalry Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 640px;

A full-grown Ogre stands nearly twice as tall as a man and several times as wide. Those who deal with Ogres find they chiefly exhibit two distinct expressions &mdash; that of glum intimidation and a sinister grin, which is far worse. Aside from rancid meat-breath that can startle a Dwarf sober, Ogres have flat, overlapping teeth that are unusually strong &mdash; they can bite through the bark of a sturdy Drakwald Oak as easily as if it was the skin of a roast chicken. When an Ogre grins, it has little to do with mirth and everything to do with showing the victim what is going to happen next.</p>\n<p>The gut of the common Ogre is of utmost importance to its owner, socially, spiritually and physically. An Ogre with a large gut is seen as wealthy and strong, for he has obviously eaten well to ensure such impressive girth. The Ogre religion revolves around eating, and the gluttonous Butchers believe that they can commune with their primitive god through this simple act. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the Ogre's vital organs are situated far lower than a man&rsquo;s. These organs are protected by a thick interlocking skein of musculature and can grind and crack food with terrific force, allowing the Ogre to digest almost anything he cares to toss into his cavernous maw. But the common Ogre leaves nothing to chance when it comes to his beloved abdomen and protects his innards further with a large circular &lsquo;gut plate&rsquo;. This is usually made of metal, beaten into shape or even cast in a mold, and will commonly depict an icon important to the owner's parent tribe. The gut-plate is secured around the Ogre's waist by a heavy belt that is often used to store the Ogre's eating tools.</p>\n<p>While Ogres are undeniably fat, underneath all that blubber resides massive slabs of pure muscle. Their thick arms end in great ham-fisted hands that wield large clubs with lethal ease. An Ogre's legs are stout and tireless, all the better to carry such a lumpen frame. With thick skin as resilient as cured leather and lungs as large as a man's torso, Ogres can survive cold inhospitable climates and are extremely tough, able to shrug off minor wounds. For this reason, only the richest and most elite Ogres bother with armor beyond their gut-plates and instead stride to battle bare-chested. His body hair is lank and greasy, and although it is common for an Ogre to be as bald as a boulder, it is rare indeed that one can be found without facial hair. presumably cultivated to trap morsels of food that escape being shoveled into his mouth by his great grasping hands. It is common amongst many tribes to tattoo themselves or daub themselves with warpaint, although, as Ogres are not hygienic in the least, it is hard to distinguish what is a tribal marking and what is post-dinner gristle.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<h4><strong>Ogre Skills, Talents &amp; Attributes</strong></h4>\n</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<h4><strong>Ogre Careers</strong></h4>\n</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<h4><strong>Trappings</strong></h4>\n</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<h4><strong>Adding Details</strong></h4>\n</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<h4><strong>Ogre Legendary Tribe Traits</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1.

Quick to mirth and anger alike, Firebellies are garrulous and vital individuals who are readily welcomed into any Ogre tribe. Fire burns within these larger-than-life prophets in a literal as well as metaphorical sense.</p>\n<p>The Fire Mouth is the largest and most powerful volcano in the Mountains of Mourn. It is an important figure in Ogre mythology, revered alongside the Great Maw by all Ogres and worshiped fervently by those tribes that have witnessed the violence of its mighty eruptions firsthand. Every year, dozens of Ogre pilgrims flock to the sides of the Fire Mouth and announce their presence to the small but influential tribe that makes its home in caves nestled into the volcano slopes. As magma courses down the sides of the Fire Mouth like drool from a Butcher's gob, the aspirants dare to undergo the gruelling Flame Trial -- a mysterious ritual held by the Firebelly tribe as their volcano god rumbles in his sleep.</p>\n<p>As will all other religious occasions in the Ogre Kingdoms, this trial by fire begins and end with the act of ingesting something. First, the hopeful Ogre must gobble down an entire cauldron full of flametoad and devilpepper curry; a repugnant mixture also useful for ending protracted sieges. Even as his gut burns, he must then catch one of the carthorse-sized fire beetles that burrow through the lava streams and devour the critter in a single sitting. It is the final task, however, that is deadliest of all.</p>\n<p>Before being accepted and becoming a Firebelly, the aspirant must drink the blood of the Fire Mouth. The supplement first climbs atop the caldera of the titanic volcano. The sight of the lake of bubbling, hissing magma below is impressive enough to take the breath away, even before the sulpherous stench assails the nostrils. Many contenders flee at this point, but those with the courage to continue are slowly lowered on thick chains inside the mouth of the volcano. The heat is such that their hair is burnt from their bodies and their eyes boil in their sockets, but the truly faithful will persevere, scooping up a skull-full of roiling lava. After being hauled back up to the edge of the Fire Mouth, the Ogre must gulp the molten rock down in a single draught. This last act is lethal even for the most gastronomically inviolable Ogre; only those with the blessing of the volcano god can survive.</p>\n<p>The survival and subsequent initiation of a new Firebelly happens perhaps a few times every decade, and often coincides with a major outburst of flame from the Fire Mouth itself. This is seen as a sure signal that it is time to make war on the lands of the weak, with the size of the battles to come coinciding with the strength of the eruption. In war, the Firebellies are well equipped to aid the Ogres, for the disciples of the volcano inherit supernatural powers. Firebellies bear a measure of protection against the fiercest conflagrations, can breathe out an inferno upon their foes and can even cast and control flaming spells.</p>\n<p>The Fire Mouth has only a few priests on hand at any time, for they are never many and most of their kind journey alone into the Ogre Kingdoms. There, a Firebelly will join a tribe for a time, spreading the creed of their molten-hearted god and bringing fiery destruction to their foes. They are lively and popular transients and fill Ogres full of wonder with their ability to bleed magma and cause a wreath of flames about their bodies with each burst of explosive flatulence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Ogre</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Academics</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Firebelly Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 640px;

Those that survive become fiercely independent warriors and savvy stalkers of beasts. Bereft of a tribe's protection and beefy companionship, the lone Hunter must learn to track and kill, while simultaneously not becoming prey to any ferocious beasts &mdash; it is all too common for the Hunter to become the hunted.</p>\n<p>To ward off the severe cold of high altitude, Hunters dress in layers of skins and pelts and can also be recognised for their tendency to carry an arsenal of weapons, trapping gear, and skinning knives. When one's days are spent stalking Ogre-eating carnivores, it is best to be prepared. Hunters are incredibly proficient with their specialised gear, able to kill beasts on the move even at range.</p>\n<p>Hunters are among the most massive and independent of their kind and think nothing of climbing to the top of a mountain whilst tracking a wounded mammoth or bull rhinox. An Ogre becomes a Hunter either by temporarily severing his ties to his tribe to state his wanderlust, or by being exiled to the harsh white wilderness of the mountain for some slight to his fellow Ogres. Either way these ties are not completely severed and a Hunter that excels at his solitary lifestyle drag an impressive kill or two back to the caves on important feast days. A Hunter is generally covered in a network of scars and tattoos, overlaid by the thick pelts of his prey protection from the arctic conditions of Mountains of Mourn. He decorates himself with, tusks, claws, fangs and skulls of the cavebeast that he has single-handedly killed and eaten. A Hunter will typically have a great beast's skull to his gut to illustrate his prowess.</p>\n<p>Although most no longer belong to a tribe, Hunters periodically drag in his impressive kills back to an Ogre camp for a special feast day. Some Hunters return to the tribe of their origins, while others wander throughout the Ogre Kingdoms. Hunters are popular visitors, for not only do they drag down some of the largest carcasses, but they liven up any feast with their rich wealth of stories about life on the mountaintops. The profusion of horrible scars and displays of beast skulls and impressive tusks also go a long way towards earning the respect of a local tribe. Before long, a Hunter's solitary ways will take over and he will amble back up the slopes.</p>\n<p>In honor of the first of the Ogre Hunter. Jhared the Red &mdash; it is common for a Hunter to keep a Sabretusk or two to help sniff out his cave-beast prey. These giant, agile feline predators often have tusks jutting from their lower jaws, used for ripping out the guts of beast larger than they are. Those that prove too difficult to domesticate instead provide both a good fight and good meal for their would-be keeper &mdash; it is a rare Hunter indeed that cannot boast a set of claw-scars somewhere about his person.</p>\n<p>Knowing how to escape the first blast of icy breath from a Frost Drake or where to aim a throwing spear to best dispatch a Mournfang are lessons that a Hunter must pick up quickly. All Hunters bear horrific scars suffered from their many battles with the monstrous denizens of the mountains &mdash; those few errors that don't prove fatal still hurt.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Ogre</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Peasant</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ogre Hunter Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 640px;

{"name":"Leadbelcher","permission":{"default":0,"lNumE4kwYfzQkIkY":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.j0uVmrf9W2Wowmqc"}},"content":"<p>&ldquo;Leadbelchers, the Ogre term for both the weapon and the unit that carries them, are the heavy artillery of the Ogre Kingdoms. Ogres have long been on the receiving end of artillery fire, and they have grown to respect and admire its tremendous killing power. Indeed, such weapons are everything an Ogre admires; they are big, loud and have a tremendous ability to smash things aside if close quarter combat is prevalent. However, forging any kind of cannon is beyond the ken of Ogres and for years they had to make do with the salvaged remnants from battlefields, ripped off their carriages and carried by the massive brutes like handguns.</p>\n<p>There are many Ogre legends about these early pioneers in the art of gunnery, like the tales of the Loose Tooth tribe and the army of Nuln, or the Ironstompers and the attack on Karak Unfirth are often the first to be told. Units baring such looted weaponry were unreliable but produced enough spectacular results that Ogre Tyrants were always greedily seeking to get their hands on more artillery pieces. It wasn't until the Ogre Kingdoms began to regularly trade with the Chaos Dwarfs that specially forged barrels became readily available. Now it is rare to see a tribe without a unit of Leadbelchers. Their potential to cause destruction and the sheer joyful noise of their blasts is simply too great for most Ogre tribes to pass up.</p>\n<p>Leadbelchers are a comparatively recent addition to the armies of the Ogre kingdoms. Few in number, these filthy and unhinged Ogres are equally obsessed with destruction and noise and arm themselves with great portable black powder weapons called Leadbelcher cannons. These are gigantic guns either scavenged from the remains of enemy artillery or earned as a reward from the great forges of the Chaos Dwarfs. Although they diverse in pattern and are prone to deterioration by the coarse and clumsy hands of their owners, each Leadbelcher cannon makes as much noise as it causes damage - not all of which is confined to the target. In any right-minded Leadbelcher's opinion, it's well worth sacrificing a couple of fingers or an eye for the sheer destructive power these weapons provide.</p>\n<p>It is easy enough to spot Ogres from a Leadbelcher unit, for their faces are scorched, they bare severe powder burns, regularly feature eye patches and often resort to protective metal plates hammered into their faces. This is the legacy of point-blank detonations and an imperfect, if not downright clumsy, understanding of black powder. Regardless, these hardy and noticeably deaf Ogres feel it is well worth sacrificing eyebrows, an eye or even a few fingers for the chance to level such devastating weapons at a foe. In fact, Leadbelchers without some scorching or disfigurement are looked down upon as novices by the rest of the unit until they manage to blast off a few chunks of themselves.</p>\n<p>To fire their weighty guns, Leadbelchers fill the barrel with shovel-like fistfuls of crude black powder, metal shot, rusty nails, an assortment of wickedly bladed weaponry and occasionally an actual cannonball or similar sized boulder. The Leadbelchers go to battle with smouldering tapers pushed through the flesh of their scalps or held between their teeth. When a prospective target comes into range, they touch the taper to the spark-holes and let loose thunderous blasts of hot metal and pure concussive force. If all goes well, these shots will blast apart the target or shred it with a salvo of rusted blades.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Ogre</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Leadbelcher Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 640px;

Known for its massive size stretching miles wide, it is a being made manifest after the forces of Cathay summoned a comet of pure Warpstone many thousands of years ago to wipe out their Ogre neighbors. They failed, despite wiping out most of the Ogre population, and instead help create a creature twisted and reformed by the Ogre&rsquo;s fears and natural lust for power. Thus, the titanic Great Maw we know today was born, with endless rows of teeth, a body stretching from one end of the world to the other and an all-consuming hunger to match. It&rsquo;s depicted as an enormous row of jagged teeth forming a circle representing the Maw&rsquo;s endless rows of teeth stretching deep into the darkness. The Great Maw is located south-east of the Ancient Giant Lands, past the Mountains of Mourn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>The Great Maw is worshipped by all Ogres throughout the Old World and beyond and is the primary dominating religion across the entirety of the Ogre Kingdoms. Even Ogres thousands of miles away from the Mountains of Mourn, who know little of The Great Maw, are at the mercy of its constant hunger, consuming in its name. Ogres adopting different religions and cultures will use foreign gods as surrogates to The Great Maw, unknowingly or not. Even Ogre worshippers of the Dark Gods are not immune to its influence. The main goal of every Ogre is to grow as fat and powerful as possible.</p>\n<p>The cult has no orders, but instead sadistic priests known as Butchers, mostly nomadic, who are tasked with being the head cooks and spellcasters of many Ogre tribes. Butchers never wear gut-plates as a sign of confidence to their connection with the Maw, trading them in for messy aprons, caked in blood and filth, to hold their terrifying looking cooking utensils for ritualistically prepared dinners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Maw temples and shrines are found in all Ogre tribes, outposts, and in many caves within the Mountains of Mourn. There is no definitive great temple to the Maw but instead thousands of sites dedicated to it. These sites are constructed by digging up massive holes in the soil and setting up painted rocks and charms depicting the symbols of the Maw. These pits are then filled as much as possible with the flesh and bones of various animals, monsters and species as tribute. The Maw-that-Walks, Skrag the Slaughterer is the closest thing to a reigning authority amongst the Butchers and Slaughtermasters of the Maw within the Mountains of Mourn. Skrag&rsquo;s name strikes awe and fear into any Ogre that utters his name, his devotion to the Maw so great he leaves even the hardiest Ogre Tyrants quaking at his presence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>The Great Maw has no penances. All it demands of its followers is to consume as many creatures and to grow as fat as possible to satiate its never-ending hunger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Strictures</strong></h3>\n<p>&bull; Eat, consume and grow fat.</p>\n<p>&bull; Eat as messily as possible.</p>\n<p>&bull; Never leave a meal unfinished.</p>\n<p>&bull; If challenged by another, the victorious Ogre must eat their opponent.</p>"}
{"_id":"jIEc62Vs34NCfDXG","name":"Irongut","permission":{"default":0,"lNumE4kwYfzQkIkY":3},"folder":"","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EtmVIm4dN41VqVkp"}},"content":"<p>&ldquo;Ironguts are the Ogres of any given tribe that have the most status and the best armour and weapons, acting as the rock-hard fighting elite of their tribe's Tyrant. They go into battle armed with massive two-handed weapons, be they enormous scimitars, rocks bolted to tree boughs with iron bands, or simply gigantic versions of the traditional Ogre club. Ironguts wear large, ornamental gut-plates to show off their elite standing and cover their meaty arms and boulder-like heads in heavy armour plating cobbled together from various conquests over the years.</p>\n<p>Although not markedly superior in strength to their fellows, Ironguts are afforded great respect, as they are usually hand-picked by the Tyrant himself. For this reason, a unit of Ironguts may well include the Tyrant's immediate family, where another might be comprised of his favorite drinking cronies. That said, it's not unheard of for the bulk of some especially formidable Ogre tribes to be made up of Ironguts. This is especially true amongst rich or powerful Ogre tribes, who can afford the expensive equipment and weaponry needed to equip a unit of Ironguts.</p>\n<p>Very little can stand before a full-blooded Ironguts charge. Any enemy troops that aren't hurled to the ground by the impact of the collision are subsequently smashed, pulped or hacked apart by the massive weapons the Ironguts carry. Any who survive that barrage of brutality risk being stomped into the dirt under by the Ironguts metal-shod feet.</p>\n<p>Ironguts are often used to spearhead an important attack or are held in reserve by some Tyrants and used to bolster the battle line. A common Ogre saying when things are going badly is that it's &lsquo;down to the Ironguts&rsquo;. Regardless of when or where they are deployed or how badly they are outnumbered, there is always a chance such a rock-hard formation can batter their way to victory.</p>\n<p>Ironguts are also typified by an unshakable belief in their own power and superiority. This stems from the extensive eating contest that Ironguts go through to prove their worth and themselves both in a crude type of initiation ritual and occasionally just to show off. The Ironguts will dispatch their intestinal prowess by eating a range of unpalatable items ranging from rusty nails, hard gravel, iron-banded cartwheels and even chains and armor, which is particularly hard to chew. It was one of these contests which gave the rise to the myth of &lsquo;When Bolgut Fell Ill&rsquo;, a favorite amongst Ogre whelps due to its fanciful nature. After all, everyone knows there is little an Irongut cannot digest.</p>\n<p>Ironguts go into battle as a powerful shock force. At the Battle of Magma River, the Rocksplitter tribe was ambushed by a huge Skaven horde. Hemmed in on all sides and outnumbered hundreds to one, the Ogre army was being slowly driven back towards the river of red-hot lava from which the battle took its name. Just when all seemed lost, a furious charge by the army's Ironguts broke a hole in the Skaven line. Swinging to left and right, the Ironguts enlarged the breach while splattering gore in sweeping arcs. Realizing their center was gone beneath the battering swipes of the Ironguts, the entire Skaven army lost heart, turned tail and bolted for it, securing both a great Ogre victory and the ensuing feast of magma-roasted ratmen.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Ogre</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Irongut Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 640px;

{"name":"Crusher","permission":{"default":0,"lNumE4kwYfzQkIkY":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.FUthwicZHW8UBxQa"}},"content":"<p>&ldquo;Ogre Bulls is a term used to describe all the fighting-age, adult male Ogres within a tribal kingdom or society, an unwashed mass of muscle and fat that can flatten landscapes as well as towns and villages when they gather in horrificly large numbers. Big, brutish and extremely violent, Ogre Bulls are simple and straightforward creatures; they know what they want and use their brawn to take it.</p>\n<p>Most Bulls don't do contemplative head scratching, preferring to smash things they don't understand. The straightforward bull-charge is their favored way to smash any opposition and greedily grab what they like. And what Ogres want is power, respect, wealth and, perhaps most of all, an endless supply of meat to feast upon. It is the Ogre way to take more than their share, in fact, most Bulls have a bully mentality that pushes them to take as much as possible. The only way to stop their aggression is a show of superior force even greater than them.</p>\n<p>Ogre Bruisers usually act as enforcers or under-chieftains within their tribal kingdom, and they spend a great deal of their time smashing and pummeling in the name of their Tyrant. As a payment for using their fighting skills and brawn, Bruisers have many privileges in the tribe. Not least of these is the license to smack seven shades of dung out of any Ogre not toeing the line, not eating messily enough, or spending too much time playing with his Gnoblars.</p>\n<p>This bullying behaviour doesn't make them popular with the rest of the tribe, though most Ogres have learnt that it's better to keep their mouths shut -- at least while the Bruiser is within hearing distance, anyway. Occasionally an Ogre will fight back, and in the unlikely event that he wins the resulting brawl, he will be allowed to take the Bruiser's place. This right of challenge serves to keep the Bruisers in line and ensures that they don't take too much advantage of their privileged position.</p>\n<p>A Bruiser is second only to the Tyrant in terms of pure size and strength and is often related to the Kingdom's ruler by blood relations. Comparable to the chieftain of an Ogre tribe, it is the Bruisers who generally keep order and disicipline within the ranks of the tribes when the Tyrant's eye is elsewhere. They are physically massive and are generally the champions of the Ogre games that play such a large part of their culture and society.</p>\n<p>Ogre Tyrants are the ruthless and tyrannical rulers of the tribal kingdoms that dot the slopes and valleys of the Mountains of Mourn. Ogres call the leaders of their tribes Tyrants and it is easy to see why. Tyrants are the biggest and strongest individuals in a hulking race that prides itself on these very same physical and mental features. To claim rulership over a group of Ogres, and even an entire tribal kingdom requires a mighty brawler, a creature powerful enough to wrestle a Giant to the ground or smash his way through a fortified gate using only his bare fists and his own raw rage and determination. This is what a Tyrant has to embody to both his enemies and his allies alike. An Ogre Tyrant uses his tremendous size and brawn to dominate all before him, earning him the right to command the tribe by displaying prodigious feats of what the Ogres respect the most -- strength, violence, extraordinary girth and a healthy, all-consuming appetite that knows no bounds.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Ogre</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Crusher Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 640px;

Size Large Optional Rules &amp; Balancing</strong></h2>\n<p>WFRP is a very customizable game experience. Much like the core game, if the GM feels there is something wrong with how the careers are designed, talents are placed, stats are rolled, then it is highly encouraged to change the rules to facilitate a better experience for everyone. However, balance is still a contentious subject to many GM&rsquo;s, so here are some optional rules to help mitigate concerns regarding @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size Large} PC&rsquo;s. For a full list of effects regarding Size Large Creatures, refer to page 341 of the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4E Core Book.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limit the Wounds to (SB + 2xTB) x 2, ignoring Willpower bonus for Wounds for Size Large PCs.</li>\n<li>Remove the Damaging Quality that Size Large PCs would gain for being one step larger than a Size Average creature.</li>\n<li>Remove the Deathblow rule gained for successfully striking Size Average targets as a Size Large PC.</li>\n<li>Do not have Size Average creatures automatically gain the @Condition[Fear] Condition during an encounter against the Size Large PC.</li>\n<li>Do not allow the Size Large PC to ignore the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat against Size Average creatures; instead, have them follow the standard rules for Disengagement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><strong>Size Large Pros and Cons</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Regardless of what combination of optional rules are used to balance play for Size Large PCs it is recommended to still grant them some of the advantages for being a Size Large creature against Size Average opponents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant them the advantage they gain in Opposed Strength Tests (and similar) against smaller creatures. It is also recommended to grant Size Large PCs a bonus for certain Strength Tests over Size Average creatures, perhaps in additional SLs, removing penalties or adding bonuses as determined by the GM. Granting them a +20 for a Strength Test that would normally be a Challenging (+0) Test for a smaller creature is a good example. This can also apply to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.I0yPc4PH5erWJLmu]{Intimidation} Tests. A bandit is much more likely to be scared off by an ogre than your average dwarf, elf, halfling or human.</li>\n<li>Allow the &ndash;2 SL penalty for opponents when they use Melee to defend in an Opposed Test for each step larger the Size Large PC is over them.</li>\n<li>Size Large PCs can use the Stomp ability against smaller creatures and have access to the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.pLW9SVX0TVTYPiPv]{Bite} Trait.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Regardless of what combination of optional rules are used to balance play for Size Large PCs it is still important to remember the disadvantages for being a Size Large creature against Size Average opponents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A smaller creature gains a bonus of +10 for WS to hit.</li>\n<li>Size Large creatures grant a +20 Combat Difficulty Modifier for all Ballistic Skill tests if shot at for being a bigger target.</li>\n<li>Harsher penalties could be inflicted towards stealth due to the mass of the Size Large creature; however, stealth should still be a possibility. It is the GMs discretion for how to handle @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.McTtmZu3Ac8Lh48W]{Stealth} Tests.</li>\n<li>Wagons and carts meant for smaller species such as humans and dwarfs could be much harder to house Size Large creatures, possibly inflicting penalties to Drive Tests due to their sheer weight. This includes lodgings at Inns, doorways, restaurants, caves, shops and other similar facilities and services, unless they are designed or specified otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These are just a few examples GMs can think of to make campaigns with Size Large PCs more immersive.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Ogre Culture &amp; Status</strong></h2>\n<p>Status for Ogres operates the same as it does within the Core Book, pages 49-50. However, amongst Ogres, status is more than just fancy titles and money. Might Makes Right in Ogre society and only the fattest and the strongest are worthy of respect.</p>\n<p>The fattest Ogres hold a special status within their twisted hierarchy. Those with the biggest guts are feared as much as they are respected, their raw strength easily shown on display whenever challenged by other Ogres or warlords of different species. A fatter Ogre&rsquo;s Status is considered one Tier higher when speaking with skinnier Ogres and cannot be defied in Ogre society. An Ogre&rsquo;s fatness is determined by their Toughness Bonus. Ogre&rsquo;s with a higher Toughness Bonus that confront Ogre&rsquo;s with a lower Toughness Bonus gain the benefits of having a higher Status over the other for social Tests. If the Toughness Bonuses are the same, compare Toughness Characteristics and see which is higher, and if those are the same then both Ogres are treated as equals. This effect does not apply to non-Ogre races such as Dwarfs, Elves, Halflings and Humans.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Ogre Hunger</strong></h2>\n<p>Like all creatures, Ogres need food to survive; however, due to their physiology and the fact their culture is built entirely around mass consumption it is much more vital for Ogres to eat regularly and in mass quantities more so than any other species.</p>\n<p>Every day without food requires a <strong>Hard (-10) @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance} Test</strong>. The first failed Tests causes a penalty of &ndash;10 Strength and Toughness and the Ogre gains the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.xneBqGOs1QS7kfUr]{Hungry} Trait. Second and subsequent failures reduce all other Characteristics by &ndash;10 and cause 2d10+TB Damage not modified by Armor Points. If the Ogre goes more than 3 days without eating, it gains the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.DrNUTPeodEgpWTnT]{Frenzy} Psychology and will attempt to kill and consume the nearest creature within its sight&mdash;including its allies, regardless of species.</p>\n<p>The Ogre must consume at least its weight in food every day, with the amount equal to quadruple its Encumbrance unmodified by Talents or Trappings. If the Ogre eats beyond the required amount, it satisfies its endless hunger for an additional day every time it consumes its weight in food.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Ogre Food Trappings</strong></h3>\n<p>Ogre equivalents of food items listed in the Core Book do exist with Ogre tribes, camps and outposts making and selling their own equivalent of rations and daily food supplies. These foods are much rarer to find as they are only purchasable from other Ogres, are completely inedible to other species and cost double the regular price for food trappings; however, Ogre food trapping are much more filling and can satisfy an Ogre&rsquo;s food requirement for one day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Edible Creatures</strong></h3>\n<p>There is no creature the Ogres cannot eat. Every species and race of the forces of Order, Destruction and Chaos are edible to the Ogres due to their unnaturally powerful stomach acids and high resistance to mutations. From undead skeletons, zombies and vampires to even plague daemons of Nurgle. There is literally no creature an Ogre isn&rsquo;t capable of eating. Ogres suffer no penalties, conditions, sicknesses or symptoms for consuming creatures of any kind, regardless of Creature Traits. If an Ogre consumes a creature with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.xsGbDFqK2qh7lsIj]{Corruption} Trait then it must roll an @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance} Test, with Difficulty Modifiers as determined by the GM, or gain Corruption Points equal to its Rating. This does not make Ogres immune to poisons or disease, but the consumption of such creatures has no effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Cooking Tests</strong></h3>\n<p>Ogres are the most infamous cooks on the entire planet, butchering and consuming any species you can imagine. Their cooking techniques stretch back thousands of years: From Dwarf &amp; Potato Stew, to Greenskin Kebabs and Halfling Dumplings. Cooking and seasoning food using the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.epSHxgJWtT1S0yMY]{Trade (Cook)} Skill makes for much more appetizing and filling meals. For every +SL during a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.epSHxgJWtT1S0yMY]{Trade (Cook)} Test you increase the Encumbrance of the food being consumed by the Ogre.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong><em> &ldquo;Glug Brewbelly is hauling back the corpses of a few Orcs he recently killed for his famous &lsquo;Orc Skin Soup&rsquo;. Glug throws the Orc corpses into the pot and starts cooking using his Trade (Cook) Skill. Glug scores +3 SL and makes himself and his fellow Maneaters a piping hot bowl of soup that fills each of them up for 13 Encumbrance worth of hunger instead of the 10 Encumbrances it would have normally filled.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Recipes</strong></h3>\n<p>What&rsquo;s cooking without some style? Recipes are a method of cooking Ogres can use to help greatly boost their prominence and prestige amongst other Ogres. Creating Recipes also adds bonuses for @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.epSHxgJWtT1S0yMY]{Trade (Cook)} Tests, as keeping track of all the necessary ingredients such as meats, herbs and spices makes it much easier to prepare future meals. The more Recipes you create and the more diverse meals you make, the more other Ogres will flock to you and pay handsomely for your quality cooking. Recipes can also be researched from Cookbooks with Ogres selling their own Recipes for large sums of GC to the highest bidder&mdash;often a Tyrant for his Butchers or Halfling cooks to make. If you have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Recipes)} Skill you can identify the Recipes of various Ogres, Halflings and other species just based off the ingredients alone. To create a Recipe the Ogre, or someone they know who will help, will need the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write} Talent and to follow the requirements below:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> Your Recipe&rsquo;s Name.</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> You need one or more meats of any species and the amount you require for the Recipe.</p>\n<p><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Extra ingredients that add a special flavor to your dish including things such as mixed spices, herbs or liquor.</p>\n<p><strong>Cooking Utensils:</strong> The tools you will need to create the Recipe, such as a cauldron for stews, grills for steaks, or pots and pans for eggs &amp; bacon.</p>\n<p><strong>Time:</strong> The cooking time it takes for your Recipe to be created. This portion is varied and depending on the food type can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The more detail you add to the Recipe the higher the bonus should be. Example:</strong><em> &ldquo;Glug Brewbelly is hauling back the corpses of a few Orcs he recently killed for his famous &lsquo;Orc Skin Soup&rsquo;. Glug throws the Orc corpses into the pot and starts cooking using his @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.epSHxgJWtT1S0yMY]{Trade (Cook)} Skill. Using his Recipe, he adds various spices imported from Araby, fresh picked herbs he recently purchased from the market and some recently collected Beastmen tongues and eyes for good measure. For following his Recipe and utilizing a wide array of ingredients Glug receives a +40 Difficulty Modifier to his @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.epSHxgJWtT1S0yMY]{Trade (Cook)} Skill Test.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Cooking and Eating Endeavors</strong></h3>\n<p>Between adventures, all Ogre characters must undertake one Endeavour managing their hunger, seeing to that they&rsquo;re well fed and comfortably living off the land they occupy. Ogres commonly host eating and cooking competitions with each other during this time. They&rsquo;re often decent sized gatherings to see who can out-eat or out-cook the other Ogres the fastest and messiest ways possible. The winner gets to enjoy the self-satisfaction of having eaten an Ogre&rsquo;s feast worth of food&hellip; and possibly a little money if they bet on the side.

{"name":"Ogre Butcher","permission":{"default":0,"lNumE4kwYfzQkIkY":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.p3ri2wu94eVVkUou"}},"content":"<p>&ldquo;Ogre Butchers are second only to Tyrants in terms of power and influence, for they not only the spiritual and magical representative of their tribe and god, but they are also the tribe's foremost cooks. Through the gory ritual preparation and consumption of meat, Butchers channel a portion of their fearsome deity's eternal hunger into feats of magic. Invoking the single-minded strength of their god, Butchers can instill unnatural vitality to their comrades, swelling the Ogres muscles and toughening their skin. They can even turn their wrath upon the enemy, causing bones to break or the ground to open up and swallow their foes.</p>\n<p>Although not as mighty as a Tyrant, a Butcher is an emissary of the Great Maw and is held in both awe and fear by his tribe. Butchers prepare all of a tribe's feasts, celebrations in which all Ogres take great pride. Around camp a Butcher is given a wide berth, for it is best not to get too close in case he is looking for extra ingredients, as fingers or whole limbs have been known to go missing. In battle, however, Butchers are most often found right in the thick of the fighting, where they use their cleavers and magic to great effect.</p>\n<p>Butchers are typically more rotund than an average Ogre and have even worse personal hygiene. They often resemble walking larders, for in addition to being caked in dried blood and offal, Butchers adorn themselves in chunks of meat, along with an array of meat hooks, cleavers, filleting knives and even special tenderisers tucked into a leather apron, or even pierced through their flabby skin. A Butcher must be prepared to use these items in their gore-soaked rituals at a moment's notice. Of all true Ogres, only the Butchers do not wear a gut-plate -- they trust their guts to the protection of the Great Maw.</p>\n<p>Any infant that conforms to the recognised portents is immediately handed to the tribe's Butcher, who bites deep into the whelp's gut to claim it as his own. The Butcher then force-feeds the child in a continual glut until the proteg&eacute; has grown fat and strong. Further initiations into the secrets of the Great Maw include gulping down rotten meat and toxins to build a tolerance to poison, learning the art of grinding bones to meal, and discovering which parts of a beast to devour to augment different magics.</p>\n<p>Butchers are responsible for blessing their tribal warriors with the power of the Great Maw itself, as well as inflicting great harm to those that dare to stand before them. Some Butchers show an inclination towards magics other than the Great Maw. Some take powers from the very animals they cull, while those who dream of an oncoming fiery comet have a penchant for reading the future and controlling the weather in destructive ways, whilst always looking to the heavens for some sky-borne disaster. Still other Butchers revel in the final act of their killing work, and their spells focus on death and dying. Regardless of their focus, Ogres believe that to cross a Butcher is to cross the Great Maw itself, a certain recipe for a painful doom.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Ogre</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Butcher Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 640px;
